+---------------------------------------------------------------+
Provides a hash table struct which can store any number of
elements indexed by a type with a defined hashing function
(usually the index type is string). Hash tables theoretically
have an O(1) lookup time, compared to an array with complexity
O(n). They will not become slower the more elements are stored
inside of a table.

Unfortunately my implementation is not optimal and cannot be
resized, meaning eventually there will be stacks of elements in
the table and it will begin to slow down. I'm planning on adding
this soon, but for now the best approach is to initialize the
table with a sufficiently large size, however this does mean
more memory is used. I'm sure you can easily find or create a
better implementation if you need optimal speed and memory usage.

<h3 style="display:inline">constants:</h3>
size_t DEFSIZE = 11
    Default size of hash table

<h2 style="display:inline">struct HashTable:</h2>
<h3 style="display:inline">constructor:</h3>
<b>HashTable</b>&lt;typename keyT,typename ValT,size_t Size=DEFSIZE&gt;()
 - keyT: type used for indexing elements
 - ValT: type of elements
 - Size: Indexes are the hash of the element % Size.
         The table can actually store more than Size elements,
         but hash collisions become more likely as the number
         of elements approaches or exceeds Size, in turn
         increasing lookup times.

<h3 style="display:inline">Methods:</h3>
size_t <b>push</b>(KeyT key, ValT val)
    adds val to the table at index key.
    returns the size of the stack where the new element is stored.
    the return value can be ignored, but it can be useful when
    determining whether or not to resize the table.

ValT <b>get</b>(KeyT key)
    returns value at index key

string <b>toString</b>()
    mainly useful for debugging, returns a string of all
    elements of the table.


<h2 style="display:inline">struct HashNode:</h2>
This file also contains a HashNode struct used by the
hash table, but for most use cases this isn&#39;t necessary
to interact with or know about.
<h3 style="display:inline">constructor:</h3>
<b>HashNode</b>&lt;typename keyT,typename ValT&gt;()
<b>HashNode</b>&lt;typename keyT,typename ValT&gt;(KeyT, ValT)

<h3 style="display:inline">Methods:</h3>
size_t <b>attach</b>(HashNode *)
    attaches a new hash node to this one, then returns the
    size of the stack.

void <b>killChildren</b>()
    destroys all children hash nodes below this one.
